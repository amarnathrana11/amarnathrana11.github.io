							<p>Curiosity was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011, at 15:02 UTC aboard the MSL spacecraft and landed on Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater on Mars on August 6, 2012, The Bradbury Landing site was less than 2.4 km from the center of the rover's touchdown target after a 563,000,000 km (350,000,000 mi) journey.

The rover's goals include: investigation of the Martian climate and geology; assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life, including investigation of the role of water; and planetary habitability studies in preparation for future human exploration.</p></a>

									<h1>Gliese 581</h1>
									
									<span><p>Gliese 581 is a star of spectral type M3V (a red dwarf) about 20 light years away from Earth in the constellation Libra. Its estimated mass is about a third of that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star to the Sun. Observations suggest that the star has a planetary system consisting of three known planets, 
									designated <b>Gliese 581 b, c, and e and a </b> possibly confirmed planet, d, in order of discovery. Additional outer planets, which received the designations Gliese 581 f, and g have been proposed, but the evidence that led to the discovery claims has been shown to be the result of stellar activity mimicking the radial velocity
									variations due to orbiting planets.</p></span>

									<h1>GSAT-18</h1>
									<span>OCT,2016 
									<P> India's latest communication satellite, GSAT-18 was inducted into the INSAT/GSAT system on October 06, 2016 from Kourou, French Guiana by Ariane-5 VA-231. Weighing 3404 kg at lift-off, GSAT-18 carries 48 communication transponders to provide Services in Normal C-band, Upper Extended C-band and Ku-bands of the frequency spectrum. GSAT-18 carries Ku-band beacon as well to help in an accurately pointing ground antennas towards the satellite.

GSAT-18 is designed to provide continuity of services on operational satellites in C-band, Extended C-band and Ku-bands. GSAT-18 was launched into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) by Ariane-5 VA-231 launch vehicle. After its injection into GTO, ISRO's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan took control of GSAT-18 and performed the initial orbit raising maneuvers using the Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) of the satellite, placing it in circular Geostationary Orbit.</span>

								<h1> MARS MISSION PROFILE </h1>
								</center>
								<h2> 1. Geo Centric Phase </h2>
								<p> The spacecraft is iinjecteeed into an Elliptic Parking Orbit by the launcher. With six main engine burns. the spacecraft is gradually meneuvered into a departure hyperbolic trajectory with wgich it escapes from the Earth's Sphere of Influence ( SOI ) with Earth's orbital velocity +V boost. The SOI of earth ends at 918347 km from the surface of the earth beyond which the perturbing force on the orbiter is mainly due to Sun. One primary concern is how to get the spacecraft to Mars, on the least amount of fuel. ISRO uses a method of travels called a Hohmann Transfer Orbit - or a Minimum Energy Transfer Orbit - to send a spacecraft from Earth to Mars with the least amount of fuel Possible. </p>
