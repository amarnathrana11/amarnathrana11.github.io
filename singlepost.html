						<h1>Mangalyan</h1>
						<span><p>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan, is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is India's first interplanetary mission and ISRO has become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency.It is the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit, and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt</p></span>

										<h2>ALIEN LIFE</h2>
										<span><p>The possibility that we earthlings are not truly alone in the universe has gained some added credibility, thanks to a new study that coincides with NASA's recent planetary discoveries. The research, published in the journal Astrobiology last week, suggests that more planets in the Milky Way galaxy may harbor advanced civilizations than we previously imagined.

Study co-authors Adam Frank and Woodruff Sullivan looked at recent discoveries of potentially habitable exoplanets and considered the odds of whether sophisticated civilizations existed on them in the past or present.

"What we showed was the 'floor' on the probability for a civilization to form on any randomly chosen planet," Frank, a University of Rochester physics and astronomy professor, told The Huffington Post in an email. "If we are the only civilization in cosmic history, then that what we calculated is the actual probability nature has set. But if the actual probability is higher than that floor, then civilizations have happened before."

										<h2>THE GALAXY</h2>
										<span><p>Galaxies are sprawling space systems composed of dust, gas, and countless stars. The number of galaxies cannot be counted—the observable universe alone may contain 100 billion. Some of these distant systems are similar to our own Milky Way galaxy, while others are quite different.</p></span>
