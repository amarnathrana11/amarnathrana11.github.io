								<h1>SUCCESFUL REPAIR OF THE international Space Station</h1>
								<span><p>On 28 June 2011, an unidentified object was seen flying near the space station. The object flew by at a relative velocity of 29,000 mph (47,000 km/h) and a distance of only 1,100 feet (340 m) from the station. The six-person crew immediately boarded the Soyuz capsules and closed the hatches on the station as well as on the Soyuz. They were near undocking when the all-clear signal was given, meaning that the danger has passed and the crew can reboard the station. This kind of incident has happened several times, and the crew would perform a debris avoidance maneuver should the situation arise.</p></span>

								<h1>ALIEN SIGNAL DISCOVERY</h1>
								<p>(CNN)Astronomers engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) are training their instruments on a star around 94 light years from Earth after a very strong signal was detected by a Russian telescope.

An international team of researchers is now examining the radio signal and its star, HD 164595 -- described in a paper by Italian astronomer Claudio Maccone and others as a "strong candidate for SETI" -- in the hopes of determining its origin.
"The signal from HD 164595 is intriguing, because it comes from the vicinity of a sun-like star, and if it's artificial, its strength is great enough that it was clearly made by a civilization with capabilities beyond those of humankind," astronomer Douglas Vakoch, president of METI International, which searches for life beyond Earth, tells CNN.
Whenever a strong signal is detected, "it's a good possibility for some nearby civilization to be detected," Maccone tells CNN.
But experts say it is highly unlikely to be a message from alien beings.
"Without corroboration from an independent observatory, a putative signal from extraterrestrials doesn't have a lot of credibility," Vakoch says.</p>

								<h2>Keplar Teliscope</h2>
								<span><p>Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-size planets orbiting other stars. Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler, the spacecraft was launched on March 7, 2009, into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit.
Designed to survey a portion of our region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near habitable zones and estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets, Kepler's sole scientific instrument is a photometer that continually monitors the brightness of over 145,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. These data are transmitted to Earth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets that cross in front of their host star.</p></span>
								<p>NASA's Kepler probe has found 54 planets in the constellation Cygnus that have a "Goldilocks" relationship to their suns—not too hot, not too cold, but just right to have water and other attributes that support life as we know it on Earth. With so many possibly Earth-like planets in one small part of space, you naturally have to wonder: Are there alien life forms all over the galaxy? And, if so, are they coming to help, enslave, exterminate, domesticate, experiment upon and/or shag us? Kepler's find is strong evidence that the answer to question 1 is "yes."</p>

										<h2>ALIEN LIFE</h2>
										<span>It was recently reported that Russian astronomers discovered a signal from space that could be extraterrestrial in origin. The signal has even gotten the attention of the scientists from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI is currently trying to figure out what created this signal and yes some do believe that it’s possible that it was created by an advanced civilization.

Does this mean that we have finally found life on other planets? Well, before you start laying down a trail of Reese’s Pieces to welcome our new intergalactic neighbors keep in mind that this is not the first time that credible scientists have discovered something that was assumed to be proof of alien life. In fact, it has happened many times before.

Often our imaginations get the better of us and scientists are no exception. It’s just human nature to try and explain something we do not understand by jumping to wild conclusions. In space exploration, there have been many instances of scientific discovery that were at first thought to be alien in origin. In 1968 Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered a signal from space that many thought could have been sent by aliens. Our exploration of Mars has turned up what we thought was proof of life or something close to it. Also, late last year astronomers from Penn State and Yale University said that they may have found some kind of alien Megastructure. But did we actually find aliens? The infographic below has the details.</span>

										<h2>THE Galaxy</h2>
										<span>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias , literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion (109) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. Previously, as of July 2015, EGSY8p7 was the most distant known galaxy, estimated to have a light travel distance of 13.2 billion light-years away.</span>
